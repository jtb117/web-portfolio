                    Hello! I'm James and I'm a senior computational biology major at the University 
                    of Pittsburgh with minors in statistics, computer science, and neuroscience. I
                    have a passion for researching problems and analyzing results. As I got involved
                    in neuroscience research, I found myself encountering the 
                    power of computer science tools over and over again. From there, my academic interests broadened to
                    incorporate these. The bredth of study I have pursued is ultimately tied 
                    together by Data Science. I've come to learn that, across all disciplines, data is
                    waiting to be analyzed. 
                    <br><br>
                    I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at DataDock Solutions. On the side,
                    I'm building a tool for the popular messaging platform GroupMe which serves as
                    a bot providing analysis, charts, and other information to users. 
                    <br><br>
                    Oppurtunities to apply my experience and develop further are always welcome.
